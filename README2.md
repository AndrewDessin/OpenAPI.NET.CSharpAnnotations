### Welcome to MS Swagger FD
Welcome to the MS Swagger FrontDoor API document. This Open API tooling continues to evolve and we are workling hard to convert the existing http://swagger site to a generic platform where engineers can build automation against a common Front Door.

### WIKI
More details about calling our Front Door can be found in our [WIKI](https://aka.ms/swaggerwiki). This information includes:
- Onboarding Your Service to MS Swagger
- API Consent Instructions
- AAD BearerToken Minting: You'll see that most of our API's require an "Authorization" header for access which is an AAD Bearer token.

Please reach out to swaggerhelp@microsoft.com before you start consuming our API so we can make sure your sxcenario is supported.
### Help
Please reach out on the MS Swagger [Stack Overflow](https://aka.ms/swaggerhelp) for help. We typically respond very quickly.

### MS Swagger SDK Libraries
- C#
- Java
- Node.JS
- Python
- Go
- Ruby

Want to jump start the consumption of our API? We  offer client SDK's (generated via [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest) ) that you can download and integrate into your app, calling our service with just a few lines of code. Look for the "Client Libraries" dropdown on this page.
